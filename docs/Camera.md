## Camera Sensor

The configuration for a camera sensor that streams camera data and renders it into a view created by the client.

- **hdmi_streaming**: A boolean representing whether the camera data gets streamed the HDMI, or the default of TCP.
- **stream_dimensions**: The dimensions of which the stream will stream over TCP. These dimensions are set in a dictionary with keys x and y with float values.
- **max_distance**: The max distance, in centimeters, the simulator's camera will look forward in the world.
- **horizontal_fov_angle**: The horizontal field of view angle, in degrees, of the simulator's camera.
- **semantic_processing**: A boolean that determines whether the camera will act as a semantic camera or a normal camera.

## Output Data
See [base sensor](Base-Sensor.md) for examples on how to get the sensor. All data that comes from sensor queues is a dictionary.

`data_camera= camera.get_message()`

### Parsed Camera Data Dictionary Keys and Values.

- **time_stamp (int):** Timestamp representing milliseconds since Sunday.
- **game_time (float):** Current game time of simulator, this value will be more prominent.
- **image (List<List<float<float>>>):** A 3D list that represents a single image following the format of **stream_dimensions_x** x **stream_dimensions_y** x 4
